# visited_places
I wanted a resource where I can annotate places I visited/lived in the world but every site either uses it spy on you or eventually asks for money, so I programmed one in R. It takes as an argument a file with coordinates and creates a world map (or map delimited by custom coordinates) with points and also generates a Delaunay triangulation on these points.


File must be csv and the column with coordinates must be called "Description"
